# Customer-Satisfaction-Pipeline

In this project, I had the opportunity to dive deep into Olist's sales data using SQL, gaining valuable insights into the factors influencing sales across different branches. ðŸ“Š By analyzing the data with SQL queries, we aimed to understand patterns, trends, and key drivers of sales performance.

But that's not all! ðŸ’¡ We took it a step further by implementing an End-to-End MLOps approach. From data ingestion to deployment, we leveraged state-of-the-art tools like MLflow, ZenML, and more to streamline our processes and ensure efficiency at every stage of the project lifecycle.

One of the highlights of our analysis was predicting customer satisfaction rates for each product. ðŸŒŸ By utilizing various parameters and advanced analytical techniques, including SQL queries, we were able to anticipate customer satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement in the purchase experience.
